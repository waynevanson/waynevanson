Hi There! Thanks for popping by.

The tools I jump to due to familiarity are React, Typescript, NodeJS, fp-ts, linux, docker and JamStack development.
Tools I endeavour to be proficient at are Haskell, PureScript, algorithms and compilers.

I'm open for work and a chat, so feel free to get in touch!
