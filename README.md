I'm a web developer/programmer who's primary toolset is `Typescript`, `React` and `NodeJS`.

Using Test Driven Development (TDD), Domain Driven Development (DDD) workflows, it becomes a joy contributing and maintaining open source software.

I spend my days cycling, programming and taking biggest step of all; the smallest.
