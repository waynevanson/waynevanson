Thanks for dropping in.

I'm a web developer/programmer who's primary toolset is `Typescript`, `React` and `NodeJS`.

As a huge fan of "true" functional programming, I utilize `fp-ts` in order to gain understanding of the abstractions Higher Kinded Types brings to deliver software and libraries.

Using Test Driven Development (TDD), Domain Driven Development (DDD) workflows, it becomes a joy contributing and mainting open source softare.

I spend my days cycling, programming and working towards my ambitions.
