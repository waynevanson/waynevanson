What's going on!

When I'm not working, I basically spend my time nerding out on fp-ts and Rust, alongside contributions to related projects.
Big into testing, familiar with the Webdriver Protocol and preach continuous delivery, where the software is always in a deployable state.

When not in a chair, I'm cooking dinner, cycling, hold my cat like a baby and spending time with family and friends.
